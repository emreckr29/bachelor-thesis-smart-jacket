# Bachelor Thesis – Smart Jacket for Physiotherapy

This repository contains the full implementation of my bachelor thesis 
project.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a wearable smart jacket equipped 
with IMU sensors to evaluate physiotherapy exercises.  
The system collects orientation data, processes it using machine learning 
models, and provides feedback to physiotherapists via a mobile/web 
application.

## System Architecture
The project consists of four main components:

- **ML API**: Machine learning models for exercise evaluation
- **Backend**: Application backend handling communication and data flow
- **Frontend**: User interface for physiotherapists
- **Data Analysis & Modeling**: Data preprocessing, feature extraction, 
and model training
